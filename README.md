# Wine-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis + Data Visualisation + Prediction Modelling

This project analyzes a wine quality dataset to understand the factors affecting wine quality. The analysis involves data visualization and data preprocessing for machine learning tasks. I have used various ML models in this project and compared their prediction accuracies. For this project, I have converted the target values to binary values (0 and 1) where each wine is either good quality(having a rating of 7 or more) or not (having a rating below 7).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, characterized by 11 physicochemical properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content and more.  Each sample is rated on a quality scale from 0 to 10, based on sensory data provided by wine experts. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between these chemical properties and the perceived quality of the wine, providing a rich ground for classification and regression analysis. The name of the dataset is 

ML Models used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN (highest accuracy)
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. ANN

I have also compared the accuracy of each of these models to determine which model can predict the given query most accurately which in our case is the KNN Classifier.
