# Wine-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis + Data Visualisation + Prediction Modelling

In this project, I have used 5 types of ML Models on the Wine Quality Dataset to predict the quality of the wine (whether it is of good quality or not)
I have also performed Data Visualisation on the important trends available from the dataset.

ML Models used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN (highest accuracy)
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. ANN

I have also compared the accuracy of each of these models to determine which model can predict the given query most accurately which in our case is the KNN Classifier.
